This shell scripts kills ft_lock proccess that runs into 42 SÃ£o Paulo Ubuntu
that locks your screen from time to time, if you want to be okay and go around
help some people without your screen locking, run this is script and it will
kill the proccess, if you want the proccess to start running again, just restart
your session, use this script but keep contributing within 42 community, have
common sense.
